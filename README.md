# 3D Localization of a Drone Based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with Ultra-wideband Sensors and On-board Camera in ROS & OpenCV - Python

I want to demonstrate the Capstone Project I've conducted for 2 semesters with my two teammates. In the project, we built a localization system based on Extended Kalman Filter. Extended Kalman Filter is fed by vision-based estimation and sensor-based distance data. The algorithm is done in ROS (Robotic Operating System) environment and the image processing (QR code detection) part is written in Python with OpenCV. After we get the outputs through ROS topics, they're visualized on MATLAB. Furthermore, Vicon Motion Capture System is used to keep the position of drone on z-axis constant.
